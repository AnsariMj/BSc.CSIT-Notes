1. Write a program to load memory locations 7090 H and 7080 H with data 40H and
50H and then swap these data.

2. Pair B contains 1122H and pair D contains 3344H. WAP to exchange the contents of B
and D pair using XCHG instruction.

3. write a program to load data in registers B and C from memory location 8000 and 8001. subtract these two numbers and output the result in port number 06H.

4. Register BC contains 8538H and register DE contain 62A5H. Write instructions to
subtract the contents of DE from the contents of BC and Place the result in BC.
